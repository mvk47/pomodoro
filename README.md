# pomodoro


This is a classic pomodoro app implemented using the standard tkinter UI design module. It is a tool that helps us in work/study. There are 3 modes:
1. Study
2. Short-break
3. Long-break

The work/study lasts for 25mins followed by a 5 minute short-break and when this cycle repeats for 4 time we can take a long-break. In the program we can change the time slots we need by changing the corresponding variables.
